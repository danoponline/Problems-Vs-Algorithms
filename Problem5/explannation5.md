# Autocomplete with Tries
Recursion is used to traverse trie tree to find suffixes and display on screen.

# Overall Complexity
Worst-case time complexity is O(n) because we have to visit all the nodes in the trie tree and space complexity is O(n) because we use a list to collect all words and display at output.
