# Rearrange Array Elements

Merge sort is used at the beginning to sort input element. The highest value becomes the most significant digit for each number followed by the next highest. If the length of the input_list is odd, one number has one more digit than another and the first 2 highest values go to the first number.

# Overall Complexity
The overall worst-case time complexity is O(n log n) and space complexity is O(n) for this problem. Complexity mostly comes from the merge sort.
