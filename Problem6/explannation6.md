# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we create intermediate containers to hold max and min value. These containers are updated every time we have a new max or min value. We traverse the whole list one time and construct the answer.

# Overall Complexity
The worst-case time complexity is O(n) for n is the length of input list. The space complexity is also O(1) because we always use the same amount of memory no matter how large input is.
