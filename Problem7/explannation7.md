# HTTPRouter using a Trie
Trie tree is used for this problem to insert and look up for handlers.

# Overall Complexity
Worst-case time complexity is O(n) because we have to visit all the nodes in the trie tree to look up and to add handler. Worst-case space complexity is also O(n) because we have to generate space for each node.
